    <p>
        This book has been reformatted from a PDF file by the ORBC Monday Men. The 
		content was downloaded from 
		<a href="http://ntslibrary.com/PDF%20Books/Apologetic%20Conversations%20by%20Vincent%20Cheung.pdf">http://ntslibrary.com/PDF%20Books/Apologetic%20Conversations%20by%20Vincent%20Cheung.pdf</a>
        on September 4, 2013 at which point
		the file was listed as available for free with no known restrictions. The
		purpose of this work is to make high-quality resources available for 
		missions work in developing areas of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        The original resource was obtained from The NTSLibrary and we would like to 
		thank them for making such resources available at no charge. Without the
		help of ministries such as theirs, we would be unable to produce these
		resources
